# Number Guessing Game
   A simple and interactive Python Project built as part of learning basic programming and logical thinking skills.

# Overview
   This project is a Number Guessing Game developed while learning python. The main objective is to guess a randomly generated number based on hints provided by the computer. Over time,new features like difficulty levels,replay option,color feedback, and score tracking were added to enhance the experience.

# Learning Goals
   while developing this project,the following python concepts were explored:
   - Loops(for,while) 
   - Conditional statements(if,elif,else)
   - Functions and modular code
   - Random number generation(random.randint)
   - User input handling
   - Using ANSI color codes for console output
   - Basic game logic design
# features
   - Basic Game: Guess the correct number between a given range.
   - Replay: Option to play again without restarting the program.
   - Levels:Choose difficulty -Easy,Medium, or Hard.Each  level changes the number range and attempt limits.
   - Scores and Colors:Keeps track of the players performance and attempts. Colored messages for better feedback(e.g.,green for correct,red for wrong)

# Example GamePlay
  - Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
  - Choose difficulty:1.Easy 2.Medium 3.Hard:3
  - Enter your guess(between 1 and 100):50
  - Too Low! Try again.
  - Enter your guess(between 1 and 100):75
  - Too High! Try again.
  - Enter your guess(between 1 and 100):63
  - Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.
  - Play again?(yes/no):yes
# Game Logic Summary
   1. Computer selects a random number within a range.
   2. Player inputs a guess.
   3. Computer compares and gives feedback(Too High/Too Low).
   4. Player continues until the correct number is guessed or attempts are over.
   5. Game ends with the score and replay option.
# Future Improvements
   - Add a Graphical User Interface(GUI) using tkinter or pygame
   - Maintain a scoeboard file to track multiple players
   - Use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts for cleaner design
   - Add sound effects or animations for engagement
